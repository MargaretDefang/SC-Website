                <h5>HEAVY METAL CODING</h5>
                <p>Heavy Metal Coding is a performance-oriented development mindset that emphasizes technical rigor,

                    music, it treats code as an engineered system built to operate under demanding conditions and
                    encourages developers to embrace complexity rather than avoid it.</p>
